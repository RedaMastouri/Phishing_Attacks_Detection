#### Business Needs:
Phishing attacks pose a significant threat to individuals and organizations by tricking victims into disclosing sensitive information. To combat this, there is a pressing need for an effective detection system that can differentiate between legitimate and phishing URLs.

#### Problem Statement:
Phishing is a type of anomaly that consists of malicious attacks intended to trick people into divulging sensitive information (Justindhas et. al., 2023). They are frequently formatted as URLs that mimic legitimate websites. Failure to identify these attacks can result in significant repercussions, such as identity theft, malware distribution, financial threats, and security breaches.

#### Objective:
This project will incorporate machine learning algorithms to identify potential phishing attempts through deceptive URLs. Some approaches to be explored include K-Means Clustering, DBSCAN, Support Vector Machine, and Deep Learning. The models will be trained and tested using the PhiUSIIL Phishing URL Dataset from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, which comprises 134,850 legitimate and 100,945 phishing URLs. The performance of each of the models will be evaluated to determine which one achieves the highest accuracy when distinguishing between legitimate and illegitimate URLs.
